        <h1>📖 About Bibliography Cleaner</h1>
        <p>A tool for lazy researchers who copy thousands of entries but only use 1% of them</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>What does this tool do?</h3>
    <p>Bibliography Cleaner helps you remove unused citation entries from your .bib files. This is especially useful for academic writers who maintain large bibliography databases but only cite a small portion of the entries in any given document.</p>
    
    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Use the <code>checkcites</code> tool to analyze your LaTeX document and identify unused citations</li>
        <li><strong>Upload:</strong> Upload your .bib file and the unused keys file to our web app</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Our tool processes your files and removes all unused entries</li>
        <li><strong>Download:</strong> Get your cleaned .bib file with only the citations you actually use</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Benefits:</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 15px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li>🎯 <strong>Cleaner documents:</strong> Only include references you actually cite</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Faster compilation:</strong> Smaller .bib files compile faster</li>
        <li>📝 <strong>Better organization:</strong> Keep your bibliography focused and relevant</li>
        <li>💾 <strong>Reduced file size:</strong> Smaller files are easier to manage and share</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Privacy & Security:</h3>
    <p>Your files are processed temporarily and are not stored on our servers. All uploaded files are automatically deleted after processing.</p>
    
    <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
    <p>This tool is based on a Python script that parses <code>checkcites</code> output and filters bibliography entries accordingly. It preserves the structure of your .bib file while removing only the unused entries.</p>
